# Foodle

Foodle is a food themed version of the popular word game "Wordle."

## About The Project

This project was initially done as a fun side project for a client, and has since gone on to be played
by thousands of users around the country.

## Technologies

As this was intended to be a simple project, the code and styling was done completely by scratch, using only these technologies: 

* JavaScript
* CSS
* HTML

In the future, I would like to add a more robust framework around the project, allowing for much easier feature expansion in the future.
